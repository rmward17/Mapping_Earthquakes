# Mapping_Earthquakes
Mapping earthquakes on a global map using JavaScript, D3, leaflet, and mapbox

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes and tectonic plates all over the world for the last seven days. Using Leaflet, D3, and JavaScript, I created a dynamic page with multiple maps and layers to view earthquake data.

The final product is on the Earthquake_Challenge branch.
